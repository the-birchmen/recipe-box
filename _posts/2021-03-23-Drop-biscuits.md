# Easy Drop Biscuits

## Ingredients

- 2 Cups All Purpose Flour
- ¾ Tablespoon Baking Powder
- ¼ Teaspoon Baking Soda
- ½ Teaspoon Salt
- 1 Cup Milk
- 1 Stick plus 1 Tablespoon Unsalted Butter (Melted) (reserve 1 tablespoon)

## Directions

1. Begin by adding all of your dry ingredients into a sifter and then sift together to evenly distribute. If you don’t have a sifter, you can use a whisk to help get that same airy effect while mixing.

2. Blend your melted butter and milk into your dough with a spatula until a sticky dough is formed. Drop your dough by tablespoons onto a pre-sprayed baking sheet.

3. I used a non-stick baking mat so they cooked evenly. We like our biscuits BIG, so I used a #12 ice cream sized scoop for quick and easy biscuits.

4. You don’t need to use anything that fancy, though, the whole point is for these to be easy.

5. Pop your biscuits in the oven at 375° and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.

6. The larger your biscuits, the longer they will need to bake. We cook our large biscuits for 15 minutes.

7. Brush the tops of your biscuits with the reserved melted butter as soon as they come out from the oven for a softer biscuit.
