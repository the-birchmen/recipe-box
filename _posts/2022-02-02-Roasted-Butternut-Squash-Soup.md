# Roasted Butternut Squash Soup

## Ingredients

_ 2 lb. cubed butternut squash
_ 1 medium onion, halved and sliced into wedges
_ 4 cloves garlic, peeled
_ 1 tsp. sea salt
_ 1/4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
_ 2 tbsp. avocado oil, or another heat-safe oil
_ 2 c. chicken broth or more, as needed
_ 1 can (about 13 1/2 oz. size) coconut milk, or 1 cup heavy cream
_ Diced apple and crumbled, cooked bacon, optional 

## Directions
- Preheat oven to 425ºF.
- Put squash cubes, onion, and garlic cloves on a large rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and drizzle oil over top. Use your hands to toss everything around so it’s evenly coated.
- Roast for 35–40 minutes on a lower oven rack, tossing things around with a spatula a couple of times during cooking.
- Transfer roasted items to a medium to large soup pot. Add chicken broth and heat to a simmer. Let it simmer for about 5 minutes and then blend it with an immersion blender (or in batches with a countertop blender) until smooth.
- Stir in coconut milk or cream. Add a little more salt, if needed, before serving. Top with diced apple and crumbled, cooked bacon, if desired.
