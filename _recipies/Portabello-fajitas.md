1. Prepare mushrooms: remove stems, spoon out gills if desired, and wipe tops clean. Cut into about 1/3 inch thick slices. Thinly slice bell peppers and onion.

2. Make taco seasoning by combining all ingredients in a bowl.

3. In a large skillet over medium heat, add 1 Tbsp. olive oil and the peppers and onions. Cook about 2 minutes.

4. Add mushroom slices and 1 Tbsp. taco seasoning. Stirring occasionally, cook another 7-8 minutes or until softened. Add juice of 1/2 lime (or more) and stir. Salt if necessary and turn off heat.

5. While the veggies are cooking, prepare your toppings of choice. Warm the tortillas if desired. Spoon the fajita mixture into the center of tortillas, and serve with toppings of choice.
